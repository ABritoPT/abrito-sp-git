PlayAds SDK
===========

Overview
--------
Integration process consists of the following steps:

0. Requirements.
1. Adding PlayAds SDK Android library project to your project.
2. Modifying AndroidManifest.xml.
3. Initializing the SDK.
4. Showing promotions.
5. ProGuard config.

Requirements
------------
Android app that targets Android 2.2 and later.

Adding Library
--------------
After unpacking the archive, you'll see a folder with a standard Android library project.
It has to be imported into a workspace of your IDE of choice (e.g. Eclipse)
and added to your existing app or game project.

Modifying AndroidManifest.xml
-----------------------------
PlayAdsSDK uses the following permissions:

   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />

And declares an Activity:

   <activity
       android:name="com.applift.playads.PlayAdsActivity"
       android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize"
       android:taskAffinity="com.applift.playads"
       android:theme="@style/Theme.PlayAds" />

Initializing the SDK
--------------------
PlayAds SDK is initialized with a single method call:

   PlayAds.init(Context ctx, int appId, String appSecret);

where appId & appSecret are the values you've got from PlayAds.
This will clear image cache & load initial settings.

It might also make sense to create an implementation of PlayAdsListener:

   private final PlayAdsListener listener = new PlayAdsListener() {

      @Override
      public void onCached(PlayAdsType type) {
         L.i("Cached %s.", type);
      }

      @Override
      public void onShown(PlayAdsType type) {
         L.i("Shown %s.", type);
      }

      @Override
      public void onTapped(PlayAdsPromo promo) {
         L.i("Opening %s in Play Store.", promo);
      }

      @Override
      public void onClosed(PlayAdsType type) {
         L.i("Closed %s.", type);
      }

      @Override
      public void onError(Exception ex) {
         L.w("Oops: %s.", ex);
      }

   };
   
and register it right after init:

   PlayAds.addListener(listener);

Please note that there must be at least one strong reference to
the listener (e.g. it could be a class member or an Activity could
implement the interface).  

Showing Promotions
------------------
PlayAds SDK has 6 methods that relate to showing promos:

   void cache()
   boolean show(Activity act)
   boolean show(Activity act, boolean cacheIfNeeded)

   void cache(PlayAdsType type)
   boolean show(Activity act, PlayAdsType type)
   boolean show(Activity act, boolean cacheIfNeeded, PlayAdsType type)

2 methods are used to cache.
2 show are used to display previously cached promos.
2 methods can show previously caching if needed.

The PlayAdsTypes are:
- GIFT_SCREEN
- SCRATCH_SCREEN
- GAME_LIST
- SLOT_MACHINE
- MEMORY_GAME
- COVER_FLOW
- INTERSTITIAL
- VIDEO

While it is recommended to cache first, it's safe to call show(...) without caching.
In this case the user will see a loading spinner until a promo is ready.

If cacheIfNeeded is set to false, showing without caching first will fail

* Listener's onClosed() callback is a good place to cache the next promo.

ProGuard Config
---------------
If using ProGuard, include proguard.cfg that comes with the SDK.
